# TodoCLI: A Simple Terminal To-Do List Manager

**Contest:** #TerminalCraft YSWS

This is a straightforward, interactive terminal application built with `Textual` to help you manage your daily tasks. It offers a quick and efficient way to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks, all from the convenience of your terminal.

## üåü What problem does it solve / How does it improve your workflow?

In a world where we constantly switch between applications, `TodoCLI` provides a streamlined experience for task management. For developers, system administrators, and anyone who spends a lot of time in the terminal, it eliminates the need to context-switch to a graphical app. It's fast, lightweight, and keeps you organized without distractions. Your tasks persist after closing the application thanks to local storage.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks via an input field.
* **View Tasks:** Clear overview of all tasks (ID, description, status).
* **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Mark tasks as complete, which are then displayed as struck-through and change their status.
* **Delete Tasks:** Permanently remove unwanted tasks.
* **Filter Completed Tasks:** Toggle between showing all tasks and only active (incomplete) tasks.
* **Persistence:** Tasks are saved locally in `tasks.json`, so you don't lose them when closing the app.
* **Interactive UI:** Navigate and interact with the app using the keyboard.
